About the Data
==============

Quiz bowl is an academic competition between schools in
English-speaking countries; hundreds of teams compete in dozens of
tournaments each year. Quiz bowl is different from Jeopardy, a recent
application area.  While Jeopardy also uses signaling devices, these
are only usable after a question is completed (interrupting Jeopardy's
questions would make for bad television).  Thus, Jeopardy is rapacious
classification followed by a race---among those who know the
answer---to punch a button first.

Here's an example of a quiz bowl question:

Expanding on a 1908 paper by Smoluchowski, he derived a formula for
the intensity of scattered light in media fluctuating densities that
reduces to Rayleigh's law for ideal gases in The Theory of the
Opalescence of Homogenous Fluids and Liquid Mixtures near the Critical
State.  That research supported his theories of matter first developed
when he calculated the diffusion constant in terms of fundamental
parameters of the particles of a gas undergoing Brownian Motion.  In
that same year, 1905, he also published On a Heuristic Point of View
Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light.  That
explication of the photoelectric effect won him 1921 Nobel in Physics.
For ten points, name this German physicist best known for his theory
of Relativity.

*ANSWER*: Albert _Einstein_

Two teams listen to the same question. Teams interrupt the question at
any point by "buzzing in"; if the answer is correct, the team gets
points and the next question is read.  Otherwise, the team loses
points and the other team can answer.

There are several ways of doing a fun and interesting project in this space: improving question answering, 

You are welcome to use any *automatic* method to choose an answer.  It
need not be similar nor build on our provided systems.  In addition to
the data we provide, you are welcome to use any external data *except*
our test quiz bowl questions (i.e., don't hack our server!).  You are
welcome (an encouraged) to use any publicly available software, but
you may want to check on Piazza for suggestions as many tools are
better (or easier to use) than others.

Possible Project Ideas
============================

Create a better system for answering questions
----------------------------------------------
The is most straightforward.  Given some text, predict what the answer is.

Create a better system for knowing when to signal to answer
-----------------------------------------------------------


Create a system to use speech data to answer questions
------------------------------------------------------

Convert between question formats using machine translation
----------------------------------------------------------

Model when an answer would be asked
-----------------------------------

Predict the difficulty of a question
------------------------------------
